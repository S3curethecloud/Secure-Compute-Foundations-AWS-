# Secure Compute Foundations (STC Academy)

Secure Compute Foundations is **Phase 2** of the SecureTheCloud (STC) Academy curriculum.

This course focuses on **how compute is placed, isolated, accessed, and observed**
inside a cloud environment — before Kubernetes, Zero Trust mesh, or advanced platforms.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design production-grade VPC and subnet layouts
- Deploy compute with **no public exposure**
- Control egress using NAT and routing intent
- Compare bastion-based access vs identity-native access
- Use VPC Flow Logs as **security telemetry**, not just networking data

---

## 🧱 Course Structure

This course is composed of **hands-on labs**, each isolated and ordered.
```

| Lab | Title |
|----|------|
| 2.1 | Secure VPC Layout & Network Tiering |
| 2.2 | Private Subnets & Default-Deny Compute |
| 2.3 | Bastion Hosts vs Zero Trust Access |
| 2.4 | VPC Flow Logs as Security Telemetry |
```

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

This course is built on these principles:

- **No direct internet exposure**
- **Least privilege networking**
- **Identity before access**
- **Telemetry before response**

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Basic AWS familiarity
- IAM / Identity fundamentals (STC Phase 1 recommended)

---

## 🧠 STC Academy Integration

This repository is:

- Ingested by **MGF (Multi-Graph-Fabric)**
- Indexed by STC Academy
- Used by STC AI for deterministic teaching
- Reused for interview and consulting scenarios

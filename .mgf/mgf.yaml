    Phase 2 — Secure Compute Foundations defines how workloads are
    placed, isolated, and observed in cloud environments. This phase
    establishes private-by-default compute, explicit network intent,
    controlled access paths, and foundational telemetry. Phase 2
    creates the conditions required for Zero Trust enforcement in
    Phase 3.

    description: >
      Workloads are deployed without public IPs and are inaccessible
      by default from the internet.

  - id: explicit_network_intent
    name: "Explicit Network Intent"
    description: >
      Routing, subnetting, and security group rules are intentional and
      minimal. No implicit trust is granted by network location.

  - id: controlled_access_paths
    name: "Controlled Access Paths"
    description: >
      Administrative and operational access paths are deliberate,
      auditable, and limited. Bastions and open inbound access are
      treated as legacy patterns.

    description: >
      Network and access telemetry are enabled to provide visibility
      into workload behavior and communication patterns.
